![Digital Time Capsule Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Digital%20Time%20Capsule-AI%20Memory%20Keeper-blue)

## 📝 Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced digital world, personal reflection and memory preservation have become increasingly important yet challenging to maintain. Traditional journaling methods lack the analytical capabilities to provide insights into emotional patterns and recurring themes in one's life. Meanwhile, existing digital solutions often prioritize social sharing over private reflection and rarely leverage AI to enhance the journaling experience.

The Digital Time Capsule addresses these challenges by creating an AI-powered personal diary application that not only securely stores memories but also analyzes them to provide meaningful insights about emotional patterns, recurring themes, and personal growth over time.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Digital Time Capsule is a sophisticated web application designed to transform the personal journaling experience through artificial intelligence. It serves as both a private diary and an intelligent memory analyzer that helps users gain deeper insights into their thoughts, emotions, and experiences over time.

Unlike traditional journaling apps, this platform utilizes natural language processing (NLP) to automatically extract key information from entries, analyze emotional content, identify recurring themes, and visualize patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Firebase API Not Enabled

If you see an error like:
```
Error: Cloud Firestore API has not been used in project [project-id] before or it is disabled.
```

**Solution**:
1. Follow the link provided in the error message to enable the Firestore API
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for the changes to propagate
3. Restart the application

### NLP Model Initialization Errors

If you see errors related to Hugging Face Transformers:
```
Error initializing summarizer: No module named 'keras.engine'
```

**Solution**:
1. Install TensorFlow: `pip install tensorflow`
2. Ensure you have sufficient disk space for model downloads
3. Check your internet connection
4. Restart the application

The application will automatically use fallback methods for NLP tasks even if model initialization fails.

### Local Storage Issues

If entries aren't being saved locally:

**Solution**:
1. Check write permissions in the application directory
2. Ensure the `data` directory exists or can be created
3. Verify JSON serialization by checking entry format

### Performance Optimization

If the application feels slow:

**Solution**:
1. Reduce the number of entries loaded at once
2. Disable some of the heavier visualizations
3. Use a more powerful machine for hosting
4. Consider using a production Streamlit deployment
